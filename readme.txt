The BMP to JPG conversion is performed with "ijl15.dll" and was obtained here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?ijl15

The Twain scanner capture uses "eztw32.dll", Easy Twain and the DLL can be found here: {http://www.geocities.com/smigman.geo/mci/download.html} and modified from here: txtCodeId=53730

The PDF file creation is based upon and minimally modified from here: http://www.vb6.us/tutorials/visual-basic-tutorial-pdf

The email with attachment and most of the interface was borrowed from txtCodeId=7519 with some modifications.

The idea is mine, for what it is worth.
