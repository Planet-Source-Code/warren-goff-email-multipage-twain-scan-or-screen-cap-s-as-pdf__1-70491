A list of various SMTP servers is included. The faxes may be previewed as can their cover letters and log. All faxes are stored and can be resent. Twain scanning is performed with "eztw32.dll" which is included and can be downloaded here: {http://www.geocities.com/smigman.geo/mci/download.html} The PDF file creation is based upon [http://www.vb6.us/tutorials/visual-basic-tutorial-pdf] and requires jpeg files.
